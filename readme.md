# Assignment 1: RESTFUL service (URL Shortener Service)
This is a simple URL shortener service implemented in Python using the Flask web framework. The service allows users to shorten long URLs into unique and compact identifiers, making them easier to share and manage.
## Getting Started
1. Install the required dependencies(flask and requests):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Flask web server:
```
python3 URL_shortening.py
```
3. The service will start running locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
4. Run the test file
```
python3 -s test_1_marking_mk2.py 
```
